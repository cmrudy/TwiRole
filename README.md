# TwoRole: A Hybrid Model for Role-related User Classification on Twitter

We publish a pre-trained version of TwiRole for role-related user classification on Twitter. The model can automatically crawl a user's profile, profile image and recent tweets, and classify a Twitter user into ðŸ“£ ***Brand***, ðŸ‘š ***Female*** or ðŸ‘” ***Male***, which is an aid to user-related research on Twitter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 2.7

### Installation

Clone this repo on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/liuqingli/TwiRole.git
```

Install essential libraries (NLTK and Spacy packages need to be downloaded manually later)

```
cd TwiRole
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up Twarc API key and secret (Please refer to [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) for more details)

```
twarc configure
```

```
consumer key: ***
consumer secret: ***

Please log into Twitter and visit this URL in your browser: https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=***
After you have authorized the application please enter the displayed PIN: ***

âœ¨ âœ¨ âœ¨  Happy twarcing! âœ¨ âœ¨ âœ¨
```

## First Classification Task 

TwiRole can detect a single user or multiple users (The screen names of users are stored in a csv file line by line). The output contains the final role and the probability of each role. Further, relevant files will be stored in "./user"

### A Single User

```
python user_classifier.py -u [screen_name]
```
Example:

```
python user_classifier.py -u BBC
Task 1: BBC  =>  Brand   [Male: 20.0%, Female: 9.5%, Brand: 70.5%]
```

### Multiple Users

```
python user_classifier.py -f [CSV File]
```

### Evaluation

First, we compare TwiRole with Ferrari et al.'s workd on the same Kaggle dataset, since they also categorized Twitter users into Brand, Female, and Male. The overall accuracy (***Acc = 0.899***) of TwiRole is highter than with Ferrari et al.'s approach (***Acc = 0.865***), and our results are more balanced across   different roles.

Second, we use TwiRole to detect the roles of users in another tweet collection, randomly choose 50 user in each class and manually check the roles of users by browsing their Twitter pages. The overall accuracy is about 77%.
